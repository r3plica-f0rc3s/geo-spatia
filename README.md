Map-based NFT Marketplace

This is a submission for Harmony Hackathon (Harmony-One-Love-2). ONE World: Geospatial NFT Marketplace.

[![VIDEO DEMO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WV7UHb4XQ6Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV7UHb4XQ6Q)


[APP DEMO](https://thecyberd3m0n.gitlab.io/geo-spatia/)

[CONTRACT REPO](https://thecyberd3m0n.gitlab.io/geo-spatia/)

## Features

- Admin creates NFT using Remix (CreateNew method, see example NFTS)
- User can bid and outbid each other
- Desktop and mobile UI (mobile UI requires some fixes)
- User can resale NFTs to each other
- Realtime UI updates, route switches, timers. No need to refresh the app
- Map usage. 3D Camera animations.
- Layering. You can add NFTs to deeper layers. They'll be visible after zooming in the map, but you should always see them on the right.
- Mapbox supports Augmented Reality (https://www.mapbox.com/augmented-reality), so we can do it too.

## Libraries

- Mapbox
- Vanta.js (for intro animation)
- Angular with Angular Material
- Three.js
- Web3

## Roadmap

- Move from layers approach to just storing "z" coordinate, and place NFT in natural 3d space. That will make animations and graphics much more awesome.
- IPFS integration
- Add some introducing information to Curtain
- Allowing upload 3D Models as NFTs (fbx graphics). Maybe animated one?
- Administrator options (adding)
- layering filters
- Cancel resale, resign from retrieve.
- Selling areas, not just objects
- More controls, map perspectives for game-like experience


## Adding NFTs

- go to Remix, load our Smart Contract
- put well formatted NFTs using CreateNew method

3 example NFTs

Svgs should have width and height set to 100%, and should be urlencoded.

You'll see new NFT in the app without refreshing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).


## Improve Performance

App will load faster if connected to dedicated Harmony node.
